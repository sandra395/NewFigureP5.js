# NewFigureP5.js
Using p5.js 

This code uses basic shapes to create a new figure based on the ones on the left. I decided to draw a cat. The sketch uses fundamental shapes like ellipses, rectangles, and lines to form the different components of the cat. Each shape is coloured specifically to differentiate the various parts of the cat, such as the head, eyes, body, ears, and tail.
